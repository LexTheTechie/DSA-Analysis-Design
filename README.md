# DSA-Analysis-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  We were to create a program to assist the Computer Science department at ABCU with printing courses in the department in alphanumerical order and then also printing out course info and prerequisite information for a given course. The goal was to organize and print the courses using a data sctructure of our choice. The data would be supplied in a txt document and we needed to ensure that the program loaded and sorted the data in alphanumerical order. 
  
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I approched the problem using a binary search tree. I used this data structure because I felt it would be simple to sort the data using a tree as many of the courses began similarly with CS and then a number. Data structures are important to understand as many other data structures could have been used but may have made sorting more difficult. For example, when using a hash table, the data is sorted fast but the table becmomes inefficient when there are a large number of collisions. Considering the options of a hash table, binary search tree, or single vector, I created a binary search tree to hold the data. 
  
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  The main roadblocks that I encountered while going through the project was working with a csv parser and ensuring that my excel file was formatted correctly. I overcame this roadblock via stackoverflow and tutorialspoint. Both websites provided useful information from my peers on how to correct any errors that I encountered. 
  
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  My work on this project has tremendously expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs. Previously, I wouldnt have a laid out design but just an idea of what I needed to code split into different classes and functions. Now, I know that design is necessary. Going from data structure to data structire became less difficult as the design was already there the structure just needed to be changed. This opened my eyes to the fact that design is everything. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  My work on this project has made an adaptable program a must have for me. It's nice when a program is readable and maintainable but, being able to reuse and adapt based upon circumstances has become extremely important to me. My previous programs have never proven to be adaptable so this will be something that I strive for with every program going forward.
